Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

The dataset includes 11355 images.
Hands are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Random rotation of between -2 and +2 degrees
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -4 and +4 percent
* Random exposure adjustment of between -4 and +4 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 5 percent of pixels
